# Add custom comment system

Suppose you are dissatisfied with the default comment system and opt to integrate an external service.

Choose and enable one of comment widget plugins:

- Disqus
- FacebookComments
- Giscus
- VkComments

Change plugin settings with your needs, then go to _Portal => Settings => Page and blocks_ area, look for the option labelled **Show page comments** and select your desired variant. Finally, save your settings.
