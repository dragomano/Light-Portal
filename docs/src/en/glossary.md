# Glossary

A list of basic concepts used in the Light Portal.

## block

Blocks are `aside` elements that have custom or other predefined content inside them. Just as some houses are made up of bricks and floors, your portal pages may contain many blocks arranged on different panels.

## page

Pages are user-generated content available at `https://{your_domain}?page={slug}`. Any user with the appropriate permissions can create pages.

## plugin

The locomotive of the portal. Ability to customize interaction with third-party modifications (including other portal mods). For example, if you need new block types, you just need to enable the corresponding plugin.

## article

Cards on the front page that display the content set in the settings: forum boards or topics, pages, images, etc.

## category

Categories are needed to categorize the portal pages. However, you can do without them if your forum is dedicated to one topic.

## tag

Tags, too, are designed to categorize portal pages. They are also the keywords used in the `keywords` meta tag.
