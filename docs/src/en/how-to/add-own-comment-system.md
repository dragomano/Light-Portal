# Add own comment system

Suppose you're not happy with the default commenting system and you decide to integrate an outside service.

Choose and enable one of comment widget plugins:

- Disqus
- FacebookComments
- Giscus
- VkComments

Change plugin settings to suit your needs, then go to _Portal => Settings => Pages and blocks_ area, look for the option labelled **Show page comments** and select your desired variant. Finally, save your settings.
