# Manage plugins

All installed portal plugins are listed here. Some of them have their own settings.

You can switch between displaying plugins in 1 column (default) or 2 columns if you wish.

If you want to change the plugin settings, click on the gear next to the plugin toggle button.

## Installing additional plugins

Some plugins are not included with the portal, they need to be installed separately. Such plugins are divided into downloadable and bonus ones available to project sponsors.

::: info
Bonus plugins are also available to translators (if at least `LightPortal.{your_language}.php` is 100% quality translated), as well as to all [active participants](../how-to/help-to-project) of the project.

The separate plugin package can be installed on the [Plugin import](./impex) page. But you can also just extract the plugin folder from the downloaded archive and move it to the directory `Sources/LightPortal/Plugins`.
