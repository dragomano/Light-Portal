# Updating

If there are no notes in the changelog of the latest version, it is enough to extract the directories `Themes` and `Sources` from the modification archive to the root of your forum, over the existing ones, and the update will be correct. But it's best to uninstall the current version before installing the new version.

:::info Note

Since version 2.4 you can upgrade without uninstalling the previous version. Simply download the new archive, go to the Package Manager and click "Upgrade" button next to the uploaded package.
