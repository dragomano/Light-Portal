# Export and import

Plugins can be exported as compressed archives, for easy transfer between forums or backup.

## Export plugins

In this section, you can export all or only selected plugins to an archive file.

## Import plugins

In this section, you can import previously saved plugins from an archive file. You can also install "downloadable" plugins distributed as archives in the same way.
