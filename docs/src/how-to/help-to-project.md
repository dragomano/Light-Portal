# How to help the project?

There are many options:

- Testing - just try the portal in practice and provide feedback if you encounter any errors or suggest innovative improvements.
- Design - you can [create your own frontpage layouts](./create-layout.md) and share them with the community. Or fix bugs in the portal UI.
- Development - you can join the project as a [plugin creator](../plugins/create-new.md).
- Documentation - can you explain a boring thing in an engaging way? Then try it!
- Translations - translations constantly need [revision, proofreading and improvement](https://crowdin.com/project/light-portal).
- Articles and reviews - do you like writing? There will always be readers!
- Sponsorship - [donations](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bugo) are always welcome.
